<p>Ethical hacking is a form of legal hacking done with the permission of an organization to help increase its security. This operation also known as Penetration Testing “Pentesting”. An ethical hacker has the skills, mindset, and tools of a hacker but is also trustworthy. As he performs these hacks as security tests for systems.</p>

<h3 id="1-footprinting">1. Footprinting</h3>
<p>Footprinting is the first phase of the ethical hacking process.The goal is to gather as much information as is reasonable and useful about a potential target with the objective of getting enough information to make later attacks more accurate. By the end of this phase you should have a profile of the target that gives enough data to plan the next phase of scanning.</p>

<h3 id="2-scanning">2. Scanning</h3>
<p>Scanning focuses on an active engagement of the target with the intention of obtaining more information. Scanning the target network will locate active hosts that can then be targeted in a the attack. Footprinting helps identify potential targets, but not all may be viable or active hosts.</p>

<h3 id="3-enumeration">3. Enumeration</h3>
<p>Enumeration is the last phase before you attempt to gain access to a system. Enumeration is the systematic probing of a target with the goal of obtaining user lists, routing tables, and protocols from the system. Information such as shares, users, groups, applications, protocols, and banners all proved useful in getting to know your target, and this information is carried forward into the attack phase.</p>

<h3 id="4-expliotation">4. Expliotation</h3>
<p>Once you have completed the first three steps, you can move into the system hacking phase. You will recognize that things are getting much more complex and that the system hacking phase cannot be completed in a single pass. it could includes cracking passwords, escalating privileges, executing applications …etc.</p>

<h3 id="5-post-expliotation">5. Post Expliotation</h3>
<p>A successful exploitation may have been to gain physical access to the oraganization network. The post execution task may be to gather up sensitive information and extract files to other machine without being caught or noticed.</p>
